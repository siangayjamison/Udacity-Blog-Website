                <p> Truth or dare is a game I’ve played all my life. But I never knew a kiddy game would have such a huge impact on it. But here we are! I started playing truth or dare by myself and I’ve never felt better. Truth is, being daring is what’s pushing my foot through the tech industry door. </p>
                   <p> My name is Siangay Jamison. I am a 21-year-old college dropout looking to become a FrontEnd Web Developer or product manager. I am a multi-hyphenate creative with 3+ years of experience in public relations, social media, and graphic design. My first dare was my decision to leave college (in my senior year). I know, *cue the confused meme*. I have a supportive family, but I know they thought I was crazy. I can’t blame them. I was a public relations major and had been working with a public relations agency for 2 years. I was pretty set up for after graduation. </p> 
                </p>
                    <p> Truth was, I wasn’t happy. I wasn’t fulfilled with the work I was doing. I couldn’t take it anymore and dared myself to be happy. So what next? I didn’t know. All I knew was that I had to figure something out & fast.
                    I came across a “day in the life of a product designer” video on TikTok and decided to look back into UX/UI design. I used to be interested in it, but dropped the idea of it because my college didn’t offer it as a major. This is what started my journey in trying to crack the code to break into tech.</p>

                    <p> I spent hours on #techtok & #techtwitter every day absorbing as much information that I could. Within the next week, I decided that I wanted to become a frontend developer, optimized my LinkedIn page, updated my new ATS safe resume, and had coffee chats scheduled. </p>
                    <p> That was in November ’21. Now in May ’22, I have tech newbies asking me for advice, went viral on LinkedIn, became a Year Up student, and recipient of Udacity x OneTen Blacks in Technology scholarship for FrontEnd Web Development.</p>

                   <p>I’m not there yet, but I am definitely on the brink of it.</p> 
                    <p> Long story short, I dared myself to do what I wanted. Truth is, you can do it too!</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,
                    Your future black girl in tech.</p>
